# flappyAI


## About the Mini-Project:
### FlappyAi is just a flappy bird normal game, but rebuilt on python so a AI can play.
### using NEAT Library I managed to get this result, the "POP" or population is how much birds are on the screen and actually playing, the "SCORE" is how far they managed to go and the "GEN" or generation is the generation of the birds based on how NEAT train and model works


## To Try:
### To try the project, you can just clone or download the zip file from the project, on the folder of the project itself, you can run a command to create a Virtual Enviorment, or if you don't want a virtualenv, just jump to installation part, if you want the virtualenv congifuration, just follow the next steps

### first of all go to the project folder in your computer using a terminal like Hyper, CMD, Bash or the VSCode Terminal
### then run the next command line

## python -m virtualenv venv

### this will create a "venv" folder in project
### to activate this virtual enviorment run the next command

## venv\Scripts\activate

### this should activate your virtual enviorment
### then now you can install the project dependencies

## pip install -r requirements.txt 

### after complete, is just run and have fun watching a AI playing Flappy Bird
